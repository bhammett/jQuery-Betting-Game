The player starts off with 10 coins and can bet any number of them. They select a number between 1 and 10, and then press the bet button to see if their number matches the randomly generated number. If they get the number exactly, they double their money. If they are only off by 1, they get to keep their bet. Otherwise they lose their bet.
